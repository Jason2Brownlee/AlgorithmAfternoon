## Name

(μ+1)-Evolution Strategy, (μ+1)-ES

## Taxonomy

The (μ+1)-Evolution Strategy is a stochastic optimization algorithm belonging to the field of Evolutionary Computation, a subfield of Computational Intelligence. It is closely related to other Evolution Strategies, such as (1+1)-ES and (μ+λ)-ES.

## Strategy

The (μ+1)-Evolution Strategy is a population-based optimization technique that maintains a population of μ individuals, each representing a candidate solution to the problem at hand. The algorithm iteratively generates new offspring by applying mutation to a single parent, selected uniformly at random from the population. The mutation operator perturbs the parent's decision variables, typically by adding a normally distributed random value to each variable. The resulting offspring is then evaluated using a fitness function, which measures its quality as a solution to the problem.

After the offspring is generated and evaluated, the algorithm performs a selection step to determine which individuals will survive to the next generation. In the (μ+1)-ES, the population for the next generation is selected from the union of the current population and the newly generated offspring. The best μ individuals, as determined by their fitness values, are retained, while the worst individual is discarded. This selection mechanism ensures that the population size remains constant at μ throughout the optimization process.

The (μ+1)-ES continues to iterate, generating new offspring and performing selection, until a termination criterion is met. Common termination criteria include reaching a maximum number of generations, finding a solution of satisfactory quality, or observing convergence in the population.

## Procedure

### Data Structures
- Population: An array of μ individuals, each representing a candidate solution to the problem.
- Fitness Function: A function that evaluates the quality of a candidate solution and returns a scalar value indicating its fitness.

### Parameters
- μ: The population size, which remains constant throughout the optimization process.
- Mutation Operator: A function that applies a perturbation to a parent individual to create an offspring. Typically, this involves adding a normally distributed random value to each decision variable.
- Termination Criterion: A condition that determines when the algorithm should stop, such as reaching a maximum number of generations or finding a satisfactory solution.

### Pseudocode
1. Initialize the population with μ randomly generated individuals.
2. Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population using the fitness function.
3. While the termination criterion is not met, repeat steps 4-7:
   4. Select a parent uniformly at random from the population.
   5. Generate an offspring by applying the mutation operator to the selected parent.
   6. Evaluate the fitness of the offspring using the fitness function.
   7. Create a temporary population by combining the current population and the offspring.
      7.1. Select the best μ individuals from the temporary population based on their fitness values.
      7.2. Update the population with the selected individuals.
8. Return the best individual found during the optimization process as the solution.

## Considerations

### Advantages
- Simplicity: The (μ+1)-ES is easy to understand and implement, making it a good choice for practitioners new to Evolutionary Computation.
- Robustness: The algorithm can handle noisy and multimodal fitness landscapes, as well as problems with non-differentiable or discontinuous objective functions.
- Parallelization: The fitness evaluations of the population can be easily parallelized, allowing for efficient use of computational resources.

### Disadvantages
- Limited Exploration: The (μ+1)-ES relies on a single offspring per generation, which may limit its ability to explore the search space effectively, especially in high-dimensional problems.
- Slow Convergence: The algorithm may converge slowly, particularly in the later stages of the optimization process, as it relies on small, random perturbations to improve the solution quality.
- Parameter Sensitivity: The performance of the (μ+1)-ES can be sensitive to the choice of the population size (μ) and the mutation operator, requiring careful tuning for each problem.

## Heuristics

### Population Size
- Start with a moderate population size (e.g., μ = 10) and adjust based on the problem complexity and available computational resources.
- Larger population sizes can improve exploration but may slow down convergence.
- Smaller population sizes can lead to faster convergence but may increase the risk of premature convergence to suboptimal solutions.

### Mutation Operator
- Use a normally distributed random perturbation with zero mean and a problem-dependent standard deviation.
- Adapt the mutation step size during the optimization process, e.g., by using a self-adaptive strategy or a deterministic schedule.
- Consider using correlated mutations or other advanced mutation schemes for high-dimensional problems or problems with strong variable interactions.

### Termination Criterion
- Set a maximum number of generations based on the available computational budget and the problem complexity.
- Monitor the progress of the best fitness value and stop the algorithm if no significant improvement is observed over a predefined number of generations.
- Use a convergence criterion based on the diversity of the population, e.g., stop when the variance of the fitness values falls below a threshold.

### Hybridization
- Consider combining the (μ+1)-ES with local search techniques, such as hill climbing or pattern search, to improve the exploitation of promising regions in the search space.
- Incorporate domain-specific knowledge or heuristics into the mutation operator or the fitness function to guide the search process more effectively.
