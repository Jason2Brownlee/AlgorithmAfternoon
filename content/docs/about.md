# About

Hi, I'm Jason Brownlee. Yes, I'm a real person, connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonbrownlee) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jason2brownlee).

I love learning about and developing implementations of algorithms, specifically algorithms from the fields of computational intelligence and metaheuristics.

Some past projects include:

* Masters degree on on [Niching Genetic Algorithms](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/PhDResearch?tab=readme-ov-file#2004).
* Weka plugin for many neural net and immune system algorithms called [WEKA Classification Algorithms](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/PhDResearch?tab=readme-ov-file#2005)
* A Java optimization algorithm library called [Optimization Algorithm Toolkit](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/OAT).
* PhD on [Clonal Selection Algorithms](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/PhDResearch?tab=readme-ov-file#2008).
* Book of 45+ algorithm descriptions titled [Clever Algorithms](https://github.com/clever-algorithms/CleverAlgorithms).
* 20+ books and 1,000+ tutorials on machine learning algorithms for my company [Machine Learning Mastery](https://MachineLearningMastery.com) (sold 2021)

**Algorithm Afternoon** is another project along these lines.

It is an experiment using LLMs (chatgpt4 and claude3) to design, develop, and apply a standardized template to describe computational intelligence algorithms.

The goal is to provide a large number of algorithm descriptions that developers may then use to learn about, get inspired by, and implement the algorithms.
