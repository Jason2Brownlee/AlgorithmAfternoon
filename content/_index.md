![Algorithm Afternoon](algorithmafternoon.png)

# Welcome Algorithm Lover!

This is your home on **lazy afternoons** to learn about and **code-up clever algorithms**.

1. Grab a hot beverage (:coffee:)
2. Pick an algorithm (:point_left:)
3. Start coding (:heart:)

## Algorithms

The algorithms in this project are drawn from across computer science, including: [computational intelligence](/docs/glossary/#computational-intelligence), [biologically-inspired computation](/docs/glossary/#biologically-inspired-computation), and [metaheuristics](/docs/glossary/#metaheuristics). You could call them machine learning or artificial intelligence algorithms, if you like.

Algorithms are listed in the table of contents (left) and organized in a rough grouping by type.

Each individual algorithm description includes a Name (common, abbreviations), Taxonomy (where it fits), Strategy (readable description), Procedure (steps, data structures, parameters), Considerations (pros and cons), and Heuristics (configure and use).

[Learn more](/docs/about/) about this project.

## Code

Once you have chosen an interesting clever algorithm, code it up in your favorite programming language. Python is popular and easy to use, why not start there?

You may need a test problem on which to test your algorithm code. Don't reinvent the wheel, there are hundreds of test problems to choose from (e.g. [function optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization)).

There are often many versions of each algorithm, rather than a canonical definition. Also, many of these algorithms often work despite bugs. This gives you flexibility in development and implementation. Get your algorithm "working" first, then try to make it "correct".

Code the algorithms yourself, it's more fun. If you get stuck, ask an LLM for some ideas or sample functions.

Share your code with fellow algorithm lovers, e.g. github, twitter, reddit, etc. Share a link to your code with me - I may set something up (e.g. code page, comments, forum, etc.)
