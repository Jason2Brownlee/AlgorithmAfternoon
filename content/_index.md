# Welcome to Algorithm Afternoon!

Grab a hot beverage (:coffee:) and spend an afternoon implementing a clever algorithm (:heart:).

## Algorithms

The algorithms are drawn from a wide fields from across computer science, including: computational intelligence, biologically-inspired computation, ad metaheuristics.

You may know many of the subfields such as stochastic optimization, swarm intelligence, evolutionary computation, artificial immune systems, and more.

Algorithms are listed in the table of contents (left) and organized in a rough taxonomy by type.

## Implementations

Once you have chosen an interesting clever algorithm, code it up in your favorite programming language.

Python is popular, why not start there.

You may need a test problem on which to test your algorithm implementation. Don't reinvent the wheel, there are hundreds of test problems to chose from.

The great thing about many of these algorithms, is they will work inspite of the bugs. Get your algorithm "working" first, then try to make it "correct".

If you get stuck, ask ChatGPT for some ideas or sample functions.
