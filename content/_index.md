# Welcome Algorithm Lover!

**Algorithm Afternoon** is your home to discover and code **clever algorithms** on **lazy afternoons**.

1. Grab a hot beverage (:coffee:)
2. Pick an algorithm (:point_left:)
3. Start coding (:heart:)

Can't choose? Try: [Hill Climbing](/stochastic/stochastic_hill_climbing/), or [Genetic Algorithm](/genetic/genetic_algorithm/), or [Particle Swarm Optimization](/particle/bare_bones_particle_swarm_optimization/).

If you get stuck, see the [help section](/help/).

## Algorithms

Hi I'm **Jason Brownlee** and I'm an **algorithm geek** like you. [Learn more](/about/).

Algorithms are listed in the table of contents (left) and are roughly grouped by type.

I included mostly stochastic optimization algorithms drawn from across subfields of computer science, such as: [computational intelligence](/glossary/#computational-intelligence) and [metaheuristics](/glossary/#metaheuristics). You could call them machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms if you like.

## Code

Why not **share your code** with fellow algorithm lovers?

- Save all of your algorithm code in a public repository, e.g. on github or gitlab.
- Share a link to your code with me: [complete my "share your code" form](https://forms.gle/t1Hv7orWpnTDDpoy7).
- Share a link to your code with algorithm loving communities on twitter, reddit, and linkedin.

If there's interest, I may set up code page, comments, forum, etc. Collaboration with fellow algorithm geeks might be even more fun!
