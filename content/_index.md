# Welcome Algorithm Lover!

**Algorithm Afternoon** is your home to discover and code **clever algorithms** on **lazy afternoons**.

1. Grab a hot beverage (:coffee:)
2. Pick an algorithm (:point_left:)
3. Start coding (:heart:)


Can't choose? Try: [Hill Climbing](/stochastic/stochastic_hill_climbing/), [Genetic Algorithm](/evolutionary/genetic_algorithm/), or [Particle Swarm Optimization](/particle/bare_bones_particle_swarm_optimization/).

## Algorithms

Algorithms are listed in the table of contents (left) and organized in a rough grouping by type.

The focus is on optimization algorithms drawn from across subfields of computer science, such as: [computational intelligence](/glossary/#computational-intelligence) and [metaheuristics](/glossary/#metaheuristics). You could call them machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms if you like.

- If you get lost, see the [Glossary](/glossary/).
- If you get stuck, see the [Help](/help/).

Hi I'm **Jason Brownlee** and I'm an **algorithm geek** like you. [Learn more](/about/) or [let's chat](/contact).

## Share Your Code

Share your code with fellow algorithm lovers!

- Save all of your algorithm code in a public repository, e.g. on github or gitlab.
- Share a link to your code with me: [complete my "share your code" form](https://forms.gle/t1Hv7orWpnTDDpoy7)
- Share a link to your code with algorithm loving communities on twitter, reddit, and linkedin.

If there is interest, I may set up something, e.g. code page, forum, etc. Collaboration with fellow algorithm geeks might be even more fun!
