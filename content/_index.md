# Welcome Algorithm Lover!

**Algorithm Afternoon** is your home to discover and code **clever algorithms** on **lazy afternoons**.

1. Grab a hot beverage (:coffee:)
2. Pick an algorithm (:point_left:)
3. Start coding (:heart:)

## Algorithms

Algorithms are listed in the table of contents (left) and organized in a rough grouping by type.

The focus is on optimization algorithms drawn from across subfields of computer science, such as: [computational intelligence](/glossary/#computational-intelligence) and [metaheuristics](/glossary/#metaheuristics). You could call them machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms if you like.

- If you get lost, see [Glossary](/glossary/).
- If you get stuck while coding, see [Help](/help/).
- If you get curious about this project, see [About](/about/).
- If you want to contact me, see [Contact](/contact).

## Share Your Code

Share your code with fellow algorithm lovers!

- Save all of your algorithm code in a public repository, e.g. on github or gitlab.
- Share a link to your code with me: [complete my "share your code" form](https://forms.gle/t1Hv7orWpnTDDpoy7)
- Share a link to your code with algorithm loving communities on twitter, reddit, and linkedin.

If there is interest, I may set up something, e.g. code page, forum, etc. Collaboration with fellow algorithm geeks might be even more fun!
