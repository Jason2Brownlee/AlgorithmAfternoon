# Strongly Typed Genetic Programming

## Name
Strongly Typed Genetic Programming (STGP)

## Taxonomy
Strongly Typed Genetic Programming is a specialized form of Genetic Programming (GP) that incorporates strong typing principles from computer science. It is closely related to Standard Genetic Programming and Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming.

## Strategy
Strongly Typed Genetic Programming extends the standard Genetic Programming paradigm by introducing a strong typing system. In STGP, each node in the program tree is associated with a specific data type, and the genetic operators are designed to maintain type consistency throughout the evolutionary process.

The main advantage of incorporating strong typing is that it helps to reduce the search space by eliminating the generation of invalid or semantically incorrect programs. By enforcing type constraints, STGP ensures that the evolved programs are syntactically correct and adhere to the specified type system.

During the initialization phase, STGP creates a population of type-consistent program trees. The genetic operators, such as crossover and mutation, are modified to respect the type constraints. For example, when performing crossover between two parent programs, STGP ensures that the swapped subtrees have compatible types at the crossover points.

Fitness evaluation in STGP is similar to standard GP, where the evolved programs are executed on a set of training data, and their performance is assessed based on a predefined fitness function. However, STGP may incorporate additional type-related metrics or penalties to guide the search towards type-correct solutions.

## Procedure
1. Initialize the population:
   1. Define the function and terminal sets for each data type.
   2. Create a population of type-consistent program trees by randomly selecting functions and terminals based on their respective data types.

2. Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population:
   1. Execute each program tree on the training data.
   2. Calculate the fitness score based on the program's performance and adherence to type constraints.

3. Perform genetic operations until the termination criterion is met:
   1. Selection: Select parent individuals from the population based on their fitness scores.
   2. Crossover:
      1. Choose a random crossover point in each parent program tree.
      2. Swap the subtrees at the crossover points, ensuring type compatibility.
   3. Mutation:
      1. Select a random node in the program tree.
      2. Replace the selected node with a randomly generated subtree of the same data type.
   4. Create a new generation by combining the offspring and the elite individuals from the previous generation.

4. Return the best-performing individual from the final generation as the solution.

### Data Structures
- Program Tree: A hierarchical structure representing the evolved program, where each node is associated with a specific data type.
- Function Set: A collection of functions for each data type, used as internal nodes in the program tree.
- Terminal Set: A collection of variables, constants, and zero-argument functions for each data type, used as leaf nodes in the program tree.
- Fitness Function: A measure of the program's performance on the given problem, considering both the program's output and its adherence to type constraints.

### Parameters
- Population Size: The number of individuals in each generation.
- Generations: The maximum number of iterations of the evolutionary process.
- Crossover Rate: The probability of performing crossover between two parent programs.
- Mutation Rate: The probability of applying mutation to an individual program.
- Tournament Size: The number of individuals participating in tournament selection.
- Elitism: The number of best-performing individuals that are directly copied to the next generation without undergoing genetic operations.

## Considerations
### Advantages
- Improved search efficiency by eliminating the generation of invalid or semantically incorrect programs.
- Enhanced readability and interpretability of the evolved programs due to the enforcement of type constraints.
- Potential for more targeted and effective search by leveraging domain-specific type information.

### Disadvantages
- Increased complexity in the implementation of the genetic operators to maintain type consistency.
- Potential limitation in the expressiveness of the evolved programs due to the strict type constraints.
- Requirement for a well-defined type system and appropriate function and terminal sets for each data type.

## Heuristics
### Function and Terminal Sets
- Ensure that the function and terminal sets for each data type are sufficiently expressive to solve the given problem.
- Include a diverse range of functions and terminals to allow for the evolution of complex and meaningful programs.
- Consider incorporating domain-specific functions and terminals that capture relevant features and operations.

### Genetic Operators
- Adjust the crossover and mutation rates based on the problem complexity and the desired balance between exploration and exploitation.
- Experiment with different selection methods, such as tournament selection or rank-based selection, to maintain population diversity and prevent premature convergence.
- Implement elitism to preserve the best-performing individuals across generations and prevent the loss of good solutions.

### Population Size and Generations
- Determine an appropriate population size based on the problem complexity and the available computational resources.
- Set the number of generations sufficiently high to allow for the evolution of effective solutions, but avoid excessive computational overhead.
- Monitor the convergence of the population and consider early stopping criteria to prevent unnecessary iterations.

### Fitness Evaluation
- Design a fitness function that accurately captures the desired behavior and performance of the evolved programs.
- Include type-related metrics or penalties in the fitness evaluation to guide the search towards type-correct solutions.
- Consider incorporating multiple objectives or constraints into the fitness function to address complex problem requirements.

### Parameter Tuning
- Perform empirical experiments to identify the optimal values for key parameters such as population size, crossover rate, and mutation rate.
- Utilize techniques like grid search, random search, or evolutionary parameter optimization to automatically tune the parameters for a given problem.
- Consider the trade-off between computational efficiency and solution quality when selecting parameter values.
