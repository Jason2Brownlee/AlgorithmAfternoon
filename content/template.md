# Algorithm Description Template

The following is the algorithm description template used to genreate a desceription of one algorithm.

Enter the canonical name of the algorithm in the [ALGORITHM] tag and generate using claude 3 opus, or better.

```
[STYLE]
Write using a "Structured and Modular Style".
- Clarity and Organization: Break down complex concepts into well-defined, self-contained sections that allow readers to quickly grasp and apply genetic algorithm principles.
- Logical Progression: Each module or section should build upon the previous one in a logical manner, gradually increasing in complexity and depth.
- Practical Focus: While maintaining a strong theoretical foundation, ensure that each section includes practical examples, exercises, or applications that demonstrate the real-world utility of genetic algorithms.
- Accessibility: Use clear, concise language and avoid unnecessary jargon. When technical terms are necessary, provide definitions or explanations to make the content accessible to all readers, regardless of their prior exposure to genetic algorithms.
- Engagement: Incorporate engaging elements such as diagrams, code snippets (in Python), and project-based learning opportunities to keep the reader actively involved and facilitate hands-on learning.
[/STYLE]

[AUDIENCE]
Target Audience Profile: Software Developers and Engineers

Demographics:
- Age Range: Early 20s to late 40s
- Occupation: Software developers, software engineers, and related professions in the technology sector
- Education Level: Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or related fields, though not exclusively. Many may also be self-taught or have completed coding bootcamps.

Professional Background:
- Experience Level: Ranges from junior developers with a couple of years of experience to senior engineers with decades in the field.
- Industry: Broad, spanning technology companies, financial services, healthcare, e-commerce, startups, and more.
- Skills: Proficient in Python and familiar with basic software development practices, version control (e.g., Git), and possibly some experience with algorithms and data structures. Interest or experience in optimization, machine learning, or data analysis is a plus.

Psychographics:
- Learning Goals: Seeking to expand their technical skillset, particularly in algorithms that can solve complex optimization problems or enhance the efficiency and performance of software projects. Keen on acquiring practical, immediately applicable knowledge.
- Motivations: Driven by a desire for professional development, problem-solving, innovation in their projects, and staying competitive in the tech industry.
- Challenges: Often facing tight project deadlines and a need for efficient, scalable solutions. They appreciate learning resources that are concise, focused, and can be quickly applied to real-world problems.
- Learning Style: Prefer hands-on learning through coding exercises and projects. Value clear, well-explained examples that demonstrate concepts in action.

Hobbies and Interests:
- Likely to engage in coding challenges, open-source projects, and continuous learning through online courses, tech meetups, and conferences. Interest in emerging technologies and trends in the software development community.

Media Consumption:
- Frequently visit tech blogs, follow industry news on platforms like Hacker News, Reddit (r/programming, r/Python), and engage with content on Stack Overflow. Prefer learning materials in various formats, including books, video tutorials, and interactive coding platforms.

Key Attributes of the Ideal Learning Resource:
- Conciseness: Can be consumed relatively quickly and does not require a long-term commitment.
- Practicality: Includes real-world applications and exercises that can be directly applied to projects.
- Clarity: Presents complex concepts in an understandable manner, ideally with examples and visual aids.
- Accessibility: Suitable for a range of experience levels, from beginners to more experienced developers looking to expand their knowledge in specific areas.

[TEMPLATE]
* Name: List canonical name used to refer to the technique followed by common aliases, abbreviations, and acronyms. Do not include any description of the technique.
* Taxonomy: Describe in one sentence how the technique fits into the field, possibly mentioning fields like Computational Intelligence, Stochastic Optimization, Biologically Inspired Computation, Optimization, Metaheuristics, etc. Mention any closely related algorithms, e.g, precursors and/or extensions, without description. Then provide a hierarchical bulleted list showing the steps through the fields and where the technique fits in.
* Strategy: Describe the computational model of the technique. Divide into logical subsections if needed to cover each information processing action of the technique. Output in terse paragraphs, possibly with subheadings, no bullet lists or pseudocode.
* Procedure: Write a pseudocode description of the technique using plain English as a numbered list of steps, sub-steps, etc. Separate into logical sections (if needed) to cover separate functions or actions. List and describe all relevant data structures in a subsection called Data Structures and list all typical parameters of the technique in a subsection titled Parameters. Do not comment on how to configure the algorithm. Do not output Python code. Do not include math or code variables.
* Considerations: List 3 of the best "Advantages" or strengths of the algorithm and a list of the most limiting "Disadvantages" or weaknesses of the algorithm. Output as two bulleted lists.
* Heuristics: Bulleted list of commonsense, best practice, and rules for applying and/or configuring the common parameters of the technique. Split into logical subsections with subheadings if needed.
