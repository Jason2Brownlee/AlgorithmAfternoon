# Coevolutionary Shared Niching

## Name

## Strategy
Coevolutionary Shared Niching is a technique that combines the principles of coevolution and niching to maintain population diversity and prevent premature convergence in evolutionary algorithms. The algorithm maintains multiple subpopulations, each focusing on a specific subproblem or niche of the search space.

### Subpopulations and Niches
In CSN, the population is divided into several subpopulations, each representing a different niche or subproblem. These subpopulations evolve independently, allowing them to specialize in their respective niches. This division helps maintain diversity and prevents any single subpopulation from dominating the search process.

### Coevolution and Interaction
The subpopulations in CSN coevolve, meaning they influence each other's evolution through their interactions. Individuals from different subpopulations are evaluated based on their performance against individuals from other subpopulations. This interaction creates a dynamic fitness landscape, where the fitness of an individual depends on its ability to solve its specific subproblem and its performance against other subpopulations.

### Shared Fitness and Collaboration
CSN introduces the concept of shared fitness, where the fitness of an individual is determined not only by its own performance but also by the performance of individuals from other subpopulations that share the same niche. This encourages collaboration between individuals within the same niche, as their success is tied to the success of their niche as a whole.

### Niche Radius and Crowding
To maintain diversity within each niche, CSN employs a crowding mechanism based on the niche radius. The niche radius determines the distance threshold within which individuals are considered to be in the same niche. When the number of individuals within a niche exceeds a certain limit, the crowding mechanism removes the least fit individuals to prevent overcrowding and maintain diversity.

## Procedure
1. Initialize the population
   1.1. Divide the population into `N` subpopulations
   1.2. Initialize individuals in each subpopulation randomly
2. Evaluate the population
   2.1. For each subpopulation `i`, evaluate individuals against individuals from other subpopulations
   2.2. Calculate the shared fitness of each individual based on its performance and the performance of individuals in the same niche
3. While termination criteria are not met, repeat:
   3.1. For each subpopulation `i`, do:
       3.1.1. Select parents using a selection operator (e.g., tournament selection)
       3.1.2. Apply genetic operators (e.g., crossover and mutation) to create offspring
       3.1.3. Evaluate the offspring against individuals from other subpopulations
       3.1.4. Calculate the shared fitness of the offspring
       3.1.5. Apply the crowding mechanism to maintain diversity within the niche
             3.1.5.1. If the number of individuals in the niche exceeds the limit, remove the least fit individuals
       3.1.6. Update the subpopulation by replacing the least fit individuals with the offspring
4. Return the best individual from each subpopulation

### Data Structures
- Population: A collection of subpopulations, each representing a different niche
- Subpopulation: A group of individuals focusing on a specific subproblem or niche
- Individual: A candidate solution to the problem, encoded as a set of parameters or decision variables
- Niche: A subset of the search space characterized by a specific subproblem or a set of similar solutions

### Parameters
- Population Size: The total number of individuals in the population
- Number of Subpopulations: The number of subpopulations or niches in the algorithm
- Niche Radius: The distance threshold used to determine if individuals belong to the same niche
- Crowding Limit: The maximum number of individuals allowed within a niche before the crowding mechanism is applied
- Genetic Operators: The crossover and mutation operators used to create offspring
- Selection Operator: The operator used to select parents for reproduction (e.g., tournament selection)
- Termination Criteria: The conditions under which the algorithm stops (e.g., maximum number of generations, convergence threshold)

## Considerations
### Advantages
- Maintains population diversity by preserving multiple niches
- Prevents premature convergence by avoiding dominance of a single subpopulation
- Promotes collaboration and specialization through coevolution and shared fitness
- Allows for efficient exploration of complex and multimodal search spaces

### Disadvantages
- Increased computational complexity due to the evaluation of individuals against multiple subpopulations
- Requires careful tuning of parameters, such as the number of subpopulations and the niche radius
- May struggle with problems that have a large number of niches or overlapping subproblems
- The performance heavily depends on the appropriate definition of niches and the effectiveness of the crowding mechanism

## Heuristics
### Determining the Number of Subpopulations
- Consider the number of distinct subproblems or niches in the problem domain
- Experiment with different values and observe the impact on population diversity and convergence
- A larger number of subpopulations can lead to better diversity but may increase computational overhead

### Setting the Niche Radius
- The niche radius should be large enough to allow for some variation within a niche but small enough to maintain separation between niches
- Consider the size of the search space and the expected distance between different subproblems
- Adaptive niche radius techniques can be employed to dynamically adjust the radius based on population characteristics

### Choosing the Crowding Limit
- The crowding limit should be set to maintain a balance between diversity and convergence within each niche
- A higher crowding limit allows for more individuals within a niche but may lead to increased competition and slower convergence
- Experiment with different values and observe the impact on population diversity and convergence speed

### Selecting Genetic Operators
- Choose genetic operators that are suitable for the problem domain and the encoding of individuals
- Crossover operators should be designed to preserve and combine meaningful building blocks from parents
- Mutation operators should introduce sufficient variation to explore the search space effectively

### Defining Termination Criteria
- Consider the desired level of solution quality and the available computational resources
- Set a maximum number of generations or a convergence threshold based on the fitness improvement over consecutive generations
- Optionally, include a runtime limit to prevent excessive computation time

### Handling Overlapping Niches
- If the problem domain has overlapping niches, consider using a more flexible niche definition or a dynamic niche radius
- Encourage collaboration between individuals from overlapping niches through shared fitness evaluation
- Employ techniques like fitness sharing or crowding to maintain diversity in the presence of overlapping niches
