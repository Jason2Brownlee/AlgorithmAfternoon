## Name

Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO)

## Taxonomy

Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization is a variant of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, which belongs to the field of Swarm Intelligence, a sub-field of Computational Intelligence.

## Strategy

Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization builds upon the basic PSO algorithm by introducing adaptive mechanisms to dynamically adjust the algorithm's parameters during the optimization process. This adaptation aims to improve the algorithm's performance and robustness in solving complex optimization problems.

The core idea behind APSO is to balance the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the swarm by adjusting the inertia weight, cognitive learning factor, and social learning factor based on the swarm's performance and diversity. The algorithm monitors the progress of the optimization process and adapts these parameters accordingly to encourage exploration when the swarm is stagnating or exploitation when the swarm is converging towards promising regions of the search space.

### Adaptive Inertia Weight

The inertia weight controls the influence of a particle's previous velocity on its current velocity. In APSO, the inertia weight is dynamically adjusted based on the swarm's diversity and the improvement rate of the global best solution. When the swarm's diversity is low or the global best solution is not improving significantly, the inertia weight is increased to promote exploration. Conversely, when the swarm's diversity is high or the global best solution is improving rapidly, the inertia weight is decreased to encourage exploitation.

### Adaptive Learning Factors

The cognitive and social learning factors determine the influence of a particle's personal best and the global best solution on its velocity update, respectively. APSO adapts these learning factors based on the swarm's convergence state and the individual particle's performance. If a particle is consistently improving its personal best solution, the cognitive learning factor is increased to encourage the particle to explore its local neighborhood more extensively. If a particle is not contributing to the improvement of the global best solution, the social learning factor is increased to guide the particle towards the globally optimal region.

## Procedure

1. Initialize the swarm
   1. Create a population of particles with random positions and velocities in the search space
   2. Evaluate the fitness of each particle
   3. Set the personal best position of each particle to its current position
   4. Set the global best position to the best position among all particles
2. Repeat until termination criteria are met
   1. For each particle:
      1. Update the particle's velocity using the adaptive velocity update equation
      2. Update the particle's position using the position update equation
      3. Evaluate the particle's fitness
      4. If the particle's current fitness is better than its personal best fitness:
         1. Update the particle's personal best position
         2. If the particle's current fitness is better than the global best fitness:
            1. Update the global best position
   2. Update the adaptive parameters (inertia weight and learning factors) based on the swarm's performance and diversity
3. Return the global best position as the optimal solution

### Data Structures

- Particle: Represents a candidate solution in the search space, consisting of its current position, velocity, personal best position, and fitness value
- Swarm: The collection of all particles in the population

### Parameters

- Population size: The number of particles in the swarm
- Maximum iterations: The maximum number of iterations allowed before termination
- Initial inertia weight: The starting value of the inertia weight parameter
- Initial cognitive learning factor: The starting value of the cognitive learning factor
- Initial social learning factor: The starting value of the social learning factor
- Adaptation strategy: The specific rules and equations used to adapt the inertia weight and learning factors during the optimization process

## Considerations

### Advantages

- Adaptive behavior: APSO dynamically adjusts its parameters to balance exploration and exploitation, leading to improved performance on a wide range of optimization problems
- Robustness: The adaptive mechanisms make APSO less sensitive to the initial parameter settings and more capable of escaping local optima
- Flexibility: APSO can be easily integrated with other optimization techniques or problem-specific heuristics to further enhance its performance

### Disadvantages

- Increased complexity: The adaptive mechanisms introduce additional complexity to the algorithm, which may increase its computational overhead and make it more challenging to implement and tune
- Problem-dependent performance: While APSO generally outperforms the basic PSO algorithm, its performance may still vary depending on the specific problem characteristics and the chosen adaptation strategy
- Sensitivity to adaptation strategy: The effectiveness of APSO heavily relies on the design of the adaptation strategy, which may require problem-specific knowledge or extensive experimentation to optimize

## Heuristics

### Parameter Settings

- Population size: Typically set between 20 and 100 particles, depending on the problem complexity and dimensionality. Larger populations may improve exploration but increase computational cost.
- Maximum iterations: Set based on the problem complexity and available computational resources. Iterate until a satisfactory solution is found or a predefined number of iterations is reached.
- Initial inertia weight: Set to a value around 0.7 to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation. Higher values (e.g., 0.9) promote exploration, while lower values (e.g., 0.4) encourage exploitation.
- Initial cognitive and social learning factors: Set both to a value around 2.0, which has been found to work well across a wide range of problems. Higher values emphasize the influence of personal and global best positions, respectively.

### Adaptation Strategies

- Inertia weight adaptation: Increase the inertia weight when the swarm's diversity is low or the global best solution is not improving significantly. Decrease the inertia weight when the swarm's diversity is high or the global best solution is improving rapidly. Common adaptation strategies include linear decreasing, nonlinear decreasing, or fuzzy adaptive methods.
- Learning factor adaptation: Increase the cognitive learning factor for particles consistently improving their personal best solutions to encourage local exploration. Increase the social learning factor for particles not contributing to the global best solution to guide them towards the globally optimal region. Adaptation strategies may involve linear increasing, nonlinear increasing, or performance-based methods.

### Termination Criteria

- Maximum iterations: Terminate the algorithm when a predefined maximum number of iterations is reached. This ensures a fixed computational budget but may not guarantee convergence to the global optimum.
- Error threshold: Terminate the algorithm when the difference between the current global best solution and the known optimum (if available) falls below a specified threshold. This criterion is suitable when the optimal solution is known or can be approximated.
- Improvement rate: Terminate the algorithm when the improvement in the global best solution over a certain number of iterations falls below a specified threshold. This criterion helps detect convergence and avoid unnecessary computations when the algorithm is no longer making significant progress.
